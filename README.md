## 🚀 Overview

Zafeguard provides cryptographic infrastructure using **Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** to eliminate single points of failure in key management and sensitive operations.

We offer:

- 🔐 **Zafeguard Vault** – Institutional-grade MPC engine for threshold signing and secure key management
- 💼 **Zafeguard Wallet** – A user-friendly non-custodial wallet backed by distributed approvals
- 🧩 **SDKs, Microservices, and Dedicated Nodes** – For seamless integration into your infrastructure

## 🎯 Mission

> **To make secure digital operations accessible, scalable, and verifiable**  
We bring modern cryptography into real-world use cases—from financial authorization to identity, access control, and beyond.

## 🧩 Platform Highlights

- **MPC-Based Key Security**
  - Keys are split into shares and never reconstructed
  - Threshold-controlled signing (e.g. 2-of-3)
  - Fault-tolerant and zero single point of compromise

- **Multi-Curve Support**
  - SECP256k1, ED25519, ED448
  - P-256, P-384, P-512
  - Supports blockchain, identity, and enterprise protocols

- **Flexible Deployment**
  - Mobile apps (iOS/Android)
  - Self-hosted MPC nodes
  - Cloud or on-premises environments

---

## 🛠️ Technology

- 🔐 **Crypto Core**: Threshold ECDSA/EdDSA, DKG, Secret Sharing
- 🖧 **Architecture**: TCP microservices, modular MPC node design, gRPC APIs
- 📱 **Clients**: React Native mobile apps, Secure Enclave / Android Keystore
- ⚙️ **SDKs**: JavaScript, Rust, REST and gRPC interfaces

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

- **Digital Asset Custody** – MPC-powered wallets and signing for institutional-grade security
- **Access Control & Identity** – Multi-device login, decentralized authentication
- **Approval Workflows** – Secure actions with multi-party policy enforcement
- **Fraud Prevention** – Embed approval layers and anomaly detection
- **Hardware Wallet Replacement** – Mobile-first, biometrics-enhanced signing

## 🧬 MPC vs Multi-Sig

| Feature               | MPC (Zafeguard)                                     | Traditional Multi-Sig                      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Key Management**     | Distributed key shares, never fully reconstructed   | Each signer holds a full private key        |
| **Signing Model**      | Collaborative threshold signature                   | Multiple individual signatures              |
| **Security Threshold** | Enforced cryptographically via MPC                 | Enforced by smart contracts/scripts         |
| **Flexibility**        | Curve-agnostic, protocol-agnostic                  | Limited to supported blockchain protocols   |
